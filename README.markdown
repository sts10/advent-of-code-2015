# Advent of Code 2015

Here are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015). I solved Days 1, 2, 3, and 5 back in 2015 using Ruby. Interesting to see how I thought back then!

In 2020, just for fun, I did Day 4 using Go (I now know what an MD5 hash is!). 

In [2019](https://github.com/sts10/advent-of-code-2019), [2018](https://github.com/sts10/advent-of-code-2018), and [2017](https://github.com/sts10/advent-of-code-2017) I used Rust in my Advent of Code attempts.
